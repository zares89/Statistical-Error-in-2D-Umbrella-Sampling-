# Statistical-Error-in-2D-Umbrella-Sampling-
This MATLAB code calculates the error in 2-dimensional umbrella sampling simulations. It is a 2D extension of the method developed by Kästner and Thiel (J. Chem. Phys. 124, 234106 (2006)). As input, it takes the minimum energy path (rep.mat) derived from the "Nudged_Elastic_Band" code.
